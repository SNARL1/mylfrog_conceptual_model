Yearly survival probability of tadpoles & & Some tadpole stages can be counted with VES, but individuals cannot be tracked. Current estimates are based on extrapolating from tadpole counts in one year to newly recruited subadult counts in the next year. & &  \\

Yearly survival probability of subadults & & Subadults can be counted with VES, but not individually tracked. Current estimates are based on extrapolating from subadult counts in one year to newly recruited adults in the next year. & & \\

Yearly survival probability of adults & Estimates are available from XX populations for XX years using capture-mark-recapture methods & & & & \\

Duration of tadpole stage & Yearly visual encounter surveys can track progression of tadpole cohorts until metamorphosis. & & & \\

Duration of subadult stage & Yearly visual encounter surveys can track progression of subadult cohorts until reproductive maturity & & & \\

Probability of an adult female reproducing in a year & & & Breeding has not been observed in the field. Breeding is assumed to happen every year based on XX & & No feasible options [Just an example, maybe there are feasible options] \\

Number of eggs produced by an adult female & & & Estimates are available from reproduction at zoo facilities, but -- despite extensive surveys -- no egg masses have been found in the field & & No feasible options \\

Survival probability of eggs & & & & No egg masses have been found in the field & No feasible options in the field \\

Adult abundance & Visual encounter surveys, cmr studies and statistical modeling provide population size estimates for XX populations over XX years & & &  \\

\hline

Subadult abundance & & Yearly VES surveys provide abundance metrics, but models have not been used to disentangle abundance and detection error for this stage class [QUESTION: Are these VES surveys repeated within a primary period?] & & & Integrated population models and N-mixture modeling could disentangle detection error and subadult abundance to get estimates of true subadult abundance \\
