### November 6, 2023

-   We restarted our discussion from 5 months ago regarding the structure of the conceptual model, how the model would be used, and what the products of this effort would be.

-   General consensus was to start diagramming a MYL frog conceptual model and use that process to help us to decide on model structure, products, etc.

-   Mark provided several papers that would be useful for us to read, one of which develops a conceptual model for amphibians in the US Midwest.

### Next steps

-   Search for papers that have developed similar conceptual models.
    Key search terms might be "adaptive management", "decision analysis".
    Add to repo folder.

-   Read papers in mylfrog_conceptual_model repo for discussion during our next meeting.

-   Before the next meeting, each of us will sketch out what a conceptual model for MYL frogs might look like.
