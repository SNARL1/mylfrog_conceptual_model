## MEETING NOTES and HOMEWORK

### November 6, 2023

-   We restarted our discussion from 5 months ago regarding the structure of the conceptual model, how the model would be used, and what the products of this effort would be.

-   General consensus was to start diagramming a MYL frog conceptual model and use that process to help us to decide on model structure, products, etc.

-   Mark provided several papers that would be useful for us to read, one of which develops a conceptual model for amphibians in the US Midwest.

### Next steps

-   Search for papers that have developed similar conceptual models. Key search terms might be "adaptive management", "decision analysis". Add to repo folder.

-   Read papers in mylfrog_conceptual_model repo for discussion during our next meeting.

-   Before the next meeting, each of us will sketch out what a conceptual model for MYL frogs might look like.

### April 9, 2024

-   Attendance: Mark, Tom

-   revisit "F.L.A.M.E." model idea: Four lifestage amphibian model with environment.

-   Used 10 minutes to execute homework assignment from last meeting: brainstorm 2-3 questions each that motivate the creation and use of a conceptual model for mountain yellow-legged frogs.

    -   Tom's:

    -   <div>

        1.  what processes affect frog population trends that we *are not* addressing but *are feasible* to study?
        2.  are some recovery tools better suited to address the ways that recruitment/survival affect declines/recovery?
        3.  can we determine processes or variables that make winter "matter" to frog survival?

        </div>

    -   Mark's:

    -   <div>

        1.  What can we learn about broad ecological questions (resilience, extremes?)
        2.  How can we leverage extensive data and natural history knowledge of MYL frog science?
        3.  With regard to viability model, can we identify how to incorporate environmental variability into frog viability?

        </div>

-   Reflecting on our answers:

    -   Convergence between Mark and Tom's questions on some topics and themes. Collectively our answers have themes of project/research "administration" (or teaching), conservation/application, and "basic" science.

-   Products?

    -   Synthesis of frog ecology (biology) and management story of 40 years and "100" publications. \[Tom's note: 100 was a Tom and Mark guess, but Google Scholar returns 3600 results for "Rana muscosa\].

        -   A mere review is unpalatable to us, and not as useful as a synthesis or model.

    -   Are we building the mountain yellow-legged frog "canon"?

-   **HOMEWORK for 4/16:**

    -   Think about products we want, or that the world would want, that the CM supports (manusripts, teaching tools).

        -   Take the FLAME model figure, and annotate according to three themes. Do different parts of the model apply to these themes differently, or, do these themes demand that we do certain things with the model?

        -   Administration (project guidance, teaching)

        -   Application (conservation)

        -   Research

    -   Other considerations:

        -   Consider the different areas of biology that we are less familiar with and would need literature or input to improve our model (e.g. immunology, physiology... )

        -   Consider geographic and taxonomic scope - include/consider southern CA R. muscosa?

        -   Consider scale: Individuals or Populations (or either, both?)

### April 16, 2024.

Attendance: Mark, Roland, Tom

Mark recapped our status and last week's notes and assignments to Roland.

Discussion notes:

-   Is it a model of individuals or populations, or both?

    -   Mark: vital rates are per individual rates that tell us something or allow us to calculate something about the population. Thinking about the CM from a particular well defined part of the **population** trajectory allowed him to get more traction.

-   Mark proposed a sub-framework for thinking about each lifestage, using Biotic and Abiotic categories. The Biotic category includes consumer, competition, resource categories or processes.

-   Can this framework elucidate current knowledge via three questions: what are the vital rates, what are their levels/ranges of variability, what are the mechanism of variability?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Roland likes this, it puts our knowledge/data in concrete terms

-   Mark: for example, a major gap is knowledge of variability in reproductive output (which is usually highly sensitive or influential in a population model).

-   Mark: This is how we can highlight unknowns, then assess the feasibility of addressing the known unknowns. This addresses all three goal/product themes.

-   Mark: another way to approach the model is with our Expectations? For a vital rate, if we can/can't measure it, can theory, or our knowledge of sensitivity (or elasticity?) tell us what "matters" \[lost the thread here a little - because Mark asked if I was taking notes\] 

    -   Roland: ...and what could the species or habitat proxy be when we can't address something?

-   Lots of discussion of demographic unknowns.

-   Mark: how does "this" differ from estimating vital rates?

-   Can Roland develop a list of persistent unknowns and unanswered, addressable questions?

-   Mark: Also, can we evaluate the degrees of knowns/unknowns/uncertainty?

    -   a lot of difference in the certainty or basis for knowledge about, for examples: frog SVL/weight, survival estimates (notably different for each life stage), or things measured in Zoos (small samples, but high certainty?),

        -   let's produce a table of those parameters -\> should have most of the parameters based on the table in the PNAS paper? Could assign quality of information description for each parameter.

-   A great observation is that all of this model development process and discussion is extendable to the rest of RIBBiTR or any other system, for developing the structure, looking at the research needs and the known/unknown/pursuable/untouchable parameters

**Example focal goal of conceptual model**: The goal of the conceptual model is to help us understand the drivers of MYLF recovery and long-term population viability. To do this, we need to 

1. Elucidate the current state of knowledge regarding MYLF vital rates defined in the conceptual model
    -  What measurements do we have for vital rates?  What are the gaps in knowing values for specific vital rates?
    - What is the magnitude of variability in vital rates among years?
        - How do predictions such as demographic buffering inform which of these parameters might be the most variable? 
        - Correlations among vital rates?
    - What are the potential mechanisms that can affect spatial and yearly variation in these parameters?
        - This gets at the question: What do we know about the mechanisms that can affect each parameter? 

-   **HOMEWORK for 4/23:**

    -   Roland, Tom Mark assignments

        -   Roland and Tom: develop your own lists of the persistent, nagging questions, unknowns, uncertainties or black boxes

        -   Mark: develop parameter table, adding information about parameter value quality and sources (do not need to add parameter values).

        -   Tom: develop the visual modelL iterate a third image of Mark's and Tom's sketches, and explore ways to make it digitally collaborative.
