    -   Mark mentioned its potential use in developing quantitative models.

    -   Adaptive management and decision analysis.

    -   Ultimate goal is to understand drivers of population dynamics, effects of environment is a big piece of that.
        Such a descriptive conceptual model would provide a useful foundation for ongoing and future modeling and other efforts.

    -   How applicable is conceptual model to other taxa?

-   Scope: incorporate individual, population, and metapopulation/landscape levels?

-   Products

    -   Published paper

    -   Others?
